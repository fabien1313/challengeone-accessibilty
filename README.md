# challengeone-accessibilty

## Description

This is my first challenge in the UT Austin Bootcamp. To complete this challenge, I refactored the original code and developed accessibility into the website. The goal of refactoring code is to restructure the code, making it cleaner than when I recieved it while not changing the functionality. Both the CSS and index.html files have been refactored, consolidated, and commented to assist with future development and accessibility for those using a screen reader. 


## Why is this important?

Implementing accessibility in your websites allows those who are unable to access your website visually the ability to use a screen reader. Accessibility helps navigate the screen reader by providing clear and concise sections along with attributions to images that are explained to help provide a great user experience.

## Accessibility

What gives a website accessibility? Tags such as `<header>, <footer>, <form>, <table>, <article> <nav>, and <section>` are called Semantic elements. Usings Semantic elements allows screen readers the ability to navigate a webpage appropriately and accurately. Non-semantic elements are `<div> and <span>`. Non-semantic elements provide no information about the content contained within the tag leaving screen readers confused and the user experience even more confusing.

## Updated

What was updated? Great question! Part of my refactoring was going into the original code and switching out the non-semantic syntax `(changing the <div> to <section>, and <header>` and replacing it with semantic syntax. Once that was done I began to restructure the index file in sequential order and organized the code with comments that go along with the consolidation of the CSS file following the exact same sequential order.
